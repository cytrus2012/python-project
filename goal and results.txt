Goal and results:
The goal of the project was to do sentiment analysis of the comments on the 
selected Kardashians posts on Instagram. This would then show which posts received
the most positive and the most negative comments. With this is would be possible
to deduce which of the Kardashians are most liked or most disliked overall.
Then to see how accurate this is, two different sentiment analysis model will be 
used. The result of the investigation is that Rob Kardashian seemed to be the most
liked. However, the second model revealed that the scores of the comments differed
between the two models. Therefore, the analysis is not precise. This is most likely
due to the internet slang and the extensive use of emojis. For example after 
a simple observation it seemed that the emoji fire was scored negatively, which in
actually isn't the case. Additionally the double heart emoji was scored as neutral,
thus it did not get a highly positive score. Although a lot of the common emojis were
scored accurately, a lot of others were not. This happened even after using the model
specifically designed for social media comments analysis. As a conclusion, it can be
deduced that the analysis of comments in general is still not fully accurate and 
would require more thorough research.
